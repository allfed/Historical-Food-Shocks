I am researching the primary causes of major food production shocks across different countries and years. For each country-year combination I provide, please search for and identify the main driver(s) of the food production decline.
Search Strategy:
Search for explicit food production shocks, agricultural crises, or crop failures for the specified country and year
Also search for broader crises (economic, political, environmental) that may have impacted food production
Focus on sources published in or after the specified year
Prioritize scientific papers, UN/FAO reports, and peer-reviewed sources
Categories to use (examples are not exhaustive):
Conflict - wars, civil unrest, territorial disputes
Economic - financial crises, currency devaluation, market collapse
Climate - droughts, extreme temperatures, late cold spells
Pest/Disease - crop diseases, locust invasions, livestock epidemics
Policy - agricultural policy changes, land reforms, trade restrictions
Infrastructure - irrigation failure, transport breakdown, storage losses
Mismanagement - soil degradation, overexploitation, poor planning
Natural Disaster - storms, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes
Other - specify the cause
Unknown - insufficient information found (make sure that you consider this category if little data is available)
You can use up to two categories for your description, but try to keep it to one and only use two if it is really clear. If you don’t have a secondary reason, just write “not applicable” in the field. 
Output format (like a csv, all in one row): Country, Year, Category (main), Category (secondary), Reason (concise), Source Name, Source Link (full link, verify it works)
Important: Verify that your sources specifically discuss food production impacts for the given year, not just general crises. Keep your output as short as possible. Don’t put in formatted in line links into the csv output.
